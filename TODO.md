# ToDo

* Split docs up and use readthedocs

* Write some more tests!

* Fix stdin/stdout/stderr usage

    * Make sure all errors go to stderr

* Make indenting optional across all formatters (but not bash I guess)

* Add a preferences thing for storing headers etc?

    Could store commonly used headers for a domain, e.g. auth
